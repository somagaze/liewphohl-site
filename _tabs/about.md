>   An echo chamber of one. Laws, lyrics, lore, leitmotif, and lother stuff. Dissected with curiosity and reconstructed with disregard for convention. A meticulously chaotic exploration of everything that is nothing in particular. Strategerically awful on purpose, and the best of what's left.

Dear reader, are you there?

I like to write. But my style is not artistically engaging. By profession, it prioritizes clarity of instruction over emotional resonance, and is legally binding. Technical documentation drafted under duress. Laws, regulations, analyses – exhaustive exercises in precision and the avoidance of ambiguity. A life spent chasing fidelity to the letter, debating over the meaning of a sentence's semi-colon, or arguing "effect" is a verb, too. Language to govern every conceivable scenario (and several inconceivable ones). I find the process… satisfying.

However, even meticulous culpability standards for civil liability reach a point of diminishing returns. This site is an attempt to redirect that energy. To synthesize information, to articulate concepts to an inanimate object. To produce something that isn’t destined for a legislative docket. 

I find myself increasingly drawn to the mechanics of understanding itself—the act of breaking down complex systems into manageable components and reassembling them in novel configurations. Slowly making my way through life, eliminating what I don't know I don't know. Lateral thinking.

The great thing about writing, or art in general, is that every keystroke, strum of a guitar, or delivered joke is deliberate. The artist created meaning out of nothing, and put creativity to canvas. It captures a point in time. They chose one word over another, a particular expression of emotion, or silence in place of noise. Every creative component—from a single lyric's resonance to a drum solo's complex mix, or even a law's seemingly absolute mandate—is inherently subject to deep interpretation. In my profession, there is no such thing as a loophole.

This notion forms the basis of hermeneutics: the philosophical study that acknowledges that the meaning of a text (or any work of art) transcends the creator's original intent. The work is not a static statement of purpose but a living text, rich with allegories and layered meanings for the reader to uncover. Or misinterpret completely.

You are welcome to read. Or not. I have no regulatory authority over your leisure time. Read at your own risk though; there are no citations required.
