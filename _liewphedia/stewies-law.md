## **Words**
*Core Lexical Crimes - Subjective Building Blocks of Chaos*
</div>

***

#### 1. includes / including / etc.

> If you are using this word to identify a subset of something, you need to understand its function is to provide a non-exhaustive list of examples. The word implies there are other items in the set. Also, adding *"but not limited to*" is redundant. If you ever find yourself wanting to provide an exhaustive list of items in a set, just use *"are."*
>
>  - Days of the week include Mon, Thu, and Sat.
>  - Days of the week are Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri, Sat, and Sun.
>
> Generally, the best use of *includes* is to provide better detail of what is in the set, and exclude items that are not similar to what the set *includes.* In the legal context, this canon is called *ejusdem generis.*
>
> - Use of the road is limited to vehicles, which includes automobiles, motorcycles, and commercial motor vehicles.
> 
> With these vehicles examples, it is clear the road is not for planes or boats. Also, it is easily defensible it excludes ground vehicles without wheels, like construction equipment or snowmobiles.

#### 1. and / or

> There is no series of things, ever, where *and/or* &nbsp;is not ambiguous. If you ever feel the need for it, break the series into conjunctive and disjunctive sets. For example:
>
> | Series                                 | Meaning                                           |
> | :------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------ |
> | A, B, or both                          | A, B, or AB                                       |
> | A, B, and C; or A, B, and D            | ABC or ABD                                        |
> | A and B with C or D                    | ABC or ABD                                        |
> | If A, then B and C; if B, then C and D | ABC or BCD                                        |
> | A, B, and C, otherwise D               | ABC or D                                          |
> | Any combination of A, B, and C         | [&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;], A, B, C, AB, AC, BC, or ABC |

## **Legalese**
*Res Ipsa Loquitur - The Aberration of Latinate Terminology Ad Absurdum.*
</div>

***

#### 1. *Per se*

> No, you're not distinguishing the intrinsic nature of something from its extrinsic qualities; you're simply qualifying a statement about something. I am willing to bet what you really mean is *intrinsically, inherently, essentially, necessarily, technically, strictly, exactly, simply, alone, solely*, or something similar. Misuse of *per se* is *negligence per se.* In fact, don't use the adverbial phrase or an adverb in its place... they suck. If you do, I will find you negligent under the theory of *res ipsa loquitur* &nbsp;because adverbs hurt me.

#### 1. Peruse

> Just perused Romeo and Juliet. Delightful comedy! Those two crazy kids pretending to be dead to get out of family dinners. Had me in stitches. Shakespeare really understood happy endings.
