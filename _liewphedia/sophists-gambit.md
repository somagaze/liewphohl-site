A Sophist's Gambit is a contrivance of a contrivance. On its face, it's meant to fuel conspiracy theories by obvious *motivated* attribution bias. The first step is to create something, like a bad commercial. The commercial is produced in such a way that the majority of viewers easily recognize, 1) it's awful; 2) mocking and critique will follow; and 3) this fuels conversation.

The conversation about the commercial, mocking it and the product that is pushed, is the point. That's the marketing. The majority of people recognize this and can't be manipulated; and people who don't recognize it are easily convinced by the former that the commercial is trying to manipulate them.

However, there must be one or more additional layers after the initial contrivance to be a Sophist's Gambit. In the case of the HeadOn commercial, the catalyst sparked a conversation where the two individuals focused more on the commercial itself than the product, and actively resisted the product because of the method of advertising. A conversation followed about marketing in general, but with the seed of headache relief planted, the two unknowingly progressed to Aleve, and a new customer was born.

The HeadOn / Aleve relationship of course isn't true, and my example is a bit too convenient (and quite unlikely). It was simply to provide a framework to describe:

Layer One:

  - Proponent has a desired outcome
  - Proponent engineers a sophistic claim
  - Opponent rejects the claim on its face

Layer Two:

  - Opponent identifies fallacies, manipulation of cognitive biases, or both
  - Opponent finds they rejected the claim... a bit too easily
  - Opponent recognizes the claim's rejection was the proponent's desire
  - Opponent is aware any further discussion continues to give the claim "air time"

Layer \[X\]:

>   The opponent may recognize the sophistry in this layer, too. *"Big-pharma wants me to think that's what big-pharma wants me to think."* If so, it is a repeat of Layer Two. Otherwise, continue...

  - Opponent is satisfied they didn't succumb to the claim, nor the manipulation
  - Opponent thinks that recognizing and countering the manipulation was the end
  - Opponent is oblivious to anything further
  - Opponent unknowingly / subconsciously succumbs to the desired outcome
  - Proponent was successful

So long as an opponent does not deconstruct the final layer, layer [X], the gambit was a success. For example, a coordinated group of individuals act in a calculated way that hints at a larger conspiracy. The hinted conspiracy isn't outlandish, nor do the individuals overtly conspire; but it's believable. Critics mock, and the actors continue to perpetuate. Meanwhile, other more-sophisticated critics begin to identify the actors are simply distracting from something else. The trouble is this "something else" is also an orchestrated faux-conspiracy. And on, and on. Success is when the "something else" isn't discovered by way of manipulation, and that non-discovery was the actors' intent.

Careful though... you may come to believe in Jewish Space Lasers or Lizard People. *Wait, what if that's what **they** want me to believe.* What about Pizza Gate? Was that just a conspiracy theory gone too far driven by projection? *It must be more than John Podesta being Italian.*  What about "Alternative Facts"? Was it more than vain attempt at normalizing doublethink? *I better buy 1984 from Amazon to learn about doublethink. Or is that what Lizard Bezos and Orwell wants...?*
